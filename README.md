IBM – Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python | Final Project

This repository contains the final project completed for the IBM course “Databases and SQL for Data Science with Python.” The project uses the Chicago Crime dataset and applies both SQL and Python to perform data cleaning, querying, exploration, and basic visualization.

Project Overview

The project includes the following steps:

1. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values

Fixing incorrect data types

Preparing the dataset for SQL and Python analysis

2. SQL Integration

Loading the dataset into an SQLite database

Creating and querying tables

Running a variety of SQL queries:
SELECT, WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, LIKE, JOIN, aggregated queries, and pattern matching.

3. Python-Based Analysis

Data manipulation with Pandas

Numerical operations with NumPy

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and simple visualizations with Matplotlib

4. Key Insights Derived

Most common crime categories

Crime distribution by location

Time-based crime trends

Crimes recorded at schools

Identification of patterns using SQL filtering and case-insensitive queries

Technologies Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib

SQLite

SQL

Purpose of the Project

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how SQL and Python can be combined effectively for data analysis. It practices essential skills such as data cleaning, database integration, querying, and exploratory analysis. The project fulfills the requirements of the IBM course and serves as a portfolio example of applied data science techniques.
